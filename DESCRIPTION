Description: This package performs statistical testing to compare predictive 
	models based on multiple observations of the A' statistic (also known as 
	Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve, or AUC). 
	Specifically, it implements a testing method based on the equivalence 
	between the A' statistic and the Wilcoxon statistic. 
	For more information, see "The meaning and use of the area under a receiver 
	operating characteristic (ROC) curve", Hanley and McNeil, Radiology, 1982.
