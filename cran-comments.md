## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Converted the DESCRIPTION reference to include a doi link.

* Updated the R code to conform to a 90-character maximum width.

## Test environments
* local OS X install (darwin15.6.0),  R version 3.4.2

## R CMD check results

1 NOTE:

Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:

These words are not mis-spelled.
